## What it does

Paste any Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Tidal, Qobuz, or Deezer link (playlist, album, artist, track, or podcast) and Antra resolves the best available source, gets it, tags it with full metadata (title, artist, artwork, genre, lyrics), and organises it into a clean `Artist / Album` folder structure ready for Navidrome, Jellyfin, or Plex.

No Python. No setup pain. One binary.

```
Links:    Spotify · Apple Music · Amazon Music · Tidal · Qobuz · Deezer
Quality:  FLAC 24-bit · FLAC 16-bit · ALAC · AAC · MP3
Output:   Auto-tagged · lyrics + artwork · Navidrome · Jellyfin · Plex ready
```

> Spotify podcasts are supported too.

## Install

Download the build for your platform from [Releases](https://github.com/anandprtp/Antra/releases) and run it. No installation required.

| Platform | File |
|---|---|
| Windows 10+ | `Antra.exe` |
| macOS 12+ (Apple Silicon) | `Antra-macOS.dmg` |
| macOS 12+ (Intel) | `Antra-macOS-Intel.dmg` |
| Linux | `Antra-Linux.AppImage` |

> **Windows Defender flag?** False positive. PyInstaller bundles sometimes trigger AV heuristics. All code is here and auditable; build from source if you prefer.

---

## Quick start

1. Launch Antra and pick your Music Library folder on first run
2. Choose your preferred output format: `FLAC 24-bit`, `FLAC 16-bit`, `ALAC`, `AAC`, or `MP3`
3. Paste any Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Tidal, Qobuz, Deezer, or Spotify podcast URL
4. Press **Add to Library**

Tracks saved, get tagged, and land in the right folder automatically.

---

## Build from source

Requirements: Python 3.11+, Go 1.23+, Node.js 18+, Wails v2

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anandprtp/Antra
cd Antra
pip install -r requirements-desktop.txt
python build_desktop.py

## Soulseek / P2P

Optional integration with the Soulseek P2P network for rare albums, limited pressings, and out-of-print releases. Antra auto-downloads and manages the backend. Just add your credentials on first run.

> The Soulseek network runs on sharing. If you download from it, share back.
